** DO NOT EDIT THE FILE style.css DIRECTLY. **

To make changes to the CSS you MUST edit and compile the file:

style.less

to

style.css

To do this you will need at bare minimum the lessc compiler found here: http://lesscss.org/

To install:

%> npm install -g less

To compile the CSS:

%> lessc style.less style.css
